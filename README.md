### AlShaafi | Corona Virus (COVID19) Detection App [![Android App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android-App-00C853?logo=android&logoColor=ffffff)](https://github.com/UsamaSarwar/App-Store/releases/download/App-Store/alshaafi.apk) [![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Web-App-211F1F?logo=google-chrome&logoColor=ffffff)](https://alshaafi.web.app)

> Diseases never come with prior intimation. In real-world scenarios reporting such diseases is a real challenge. This challenge is completed by "Al-Shaafi"; an idea to automate the process of disease prediction and effective treatment. Through this app, you would be able to get one more way to properly medical checkups without visiting hospitals. We have developed an expert system named ‚ÄúAl-Shaafi‚Äù that provides medical facilities to the patients in the minimum possible time. This system may diagnose the patient. This diagnosis will inform the patients about their disease they are suffering from. This expert system also facilitates the patients in the treatment for the respective illness they are suffering with. In this system, a team of dedicated and expert doctors would be available if a patient needs medical consultancy. Emergency services like Ambulance and Rescue are available 24/7. This expert system also facilitates women in obstetrical and gynecological treatment. It has been observed that when the patient visits the doctor for the next time, the medical history of the patient is usually overlooked. Al-Shaafi provides the facility to record the patient's histories. This expert system virtually connects a patient to the doctor for medical consultancy.
